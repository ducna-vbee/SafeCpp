## API Reference

### Introduction

`Safe` provides a runtime library that tracks every heap-allocated instance of types that inherit `Safe::SafeContextBase` and offers recycling/repurpose mechanisms. It provides a mechanism that is similar to managed contexts in programming languages like C#, that is to handle memory management automatically. However, standard C++ doesn't have neither garbage collectors (for high performance) and reference counts for pointers and references (for preventing the CPU from crawling). The idea is to make sure any instance of any type that inherits from `Safe::SafeContextBase`, once allocated on memory heap, must be managed and all pointers to them are tracked. In this safe context, the default allocation is on heap-based memory, and memory allocation on stack is just an extension that bypasses the managed runtime for higher performance and flexibility. Without allowing stack-based allocation, a variable of a safe type can't be a member of another class or structure without defining them as a pointer type and reference type. C++ also doesn't overriding the default behaviors of raw pointers and references. A reference, once bound to a variable, can't be assigned to any other variable. Thus, stack-based allocation under safe context can lead to dangling pointers or dangling references.

The term "managed types" in this library can be understood as types that inherit from `Safe::SafeContextBase` and don't need to manage memory manually. Unlike other programming languages like C# have automatic garbage collection for reference types (the C# classes) which rely on reference counting, C++ doesn't have any language feature that allow reference counting for pointer(s) and reference(s). Smart pointer types implemented in C++ standard library may manage memory automatically. But if the smart pointers themselves are allocated on memory heap, they must be deallocated manually and thus potentially leak memory. So, polymorphic instance(s) of `Safe::SafeContextBase` allocated on memory heap will have neither dangling pointer nor dangling reference nor memory leak. Furthermore, the lifetime(s) of the instance(s) will be as long as possible to make sure the pointer(s) and the reference(s) are always valid in a program. This design will hold a lot of pressure on the memory if not used carefully.

You may ask if there is any way to handle the case where the memory usages of programs that use `Safe::SafeContextBase` are heavy? The only way to reclaim memory in this situation is to recycle instances that are no longer intented to be used. However, that will be confusing as you are holding a reference to an instance that has been recycled and after being repurposed, the underlying data of that instance changed dramatically. This is a trade-off for being safe, since unlike programming languages such as Rust, data in C++ is mutable by default.

`Safe` also has a feature that allows bulk allocation (memory arena) that quickly allocates multiple instances of the same type derived from `Safe::SafeContextBase`, for high performance purposes. It is the class template `Safe::SafeContextBase::SafeMemoryChunk` that is designed to inherit `Safe::SafeContextBase` and be capable of creating and managing memory chunk(s). The namespace also has several utility types that provide useful features under the safe context, like `SafeFunction` and `SafeEvent`.


### Definitions

- `CPP_SAFE_LIBRARY_TRADE` — an annotation macro that is used to export/import public symbols in dynamic linkages on Windows; expand the macro by defining one of the build flags:
	- `CPP_SAFE_DYNAMICALLY_LINKED_LIBRARY_EXPORT` (defined when building the dynamically linked library on Windows, expands to `__declspec(dllexport)`).
	- `CPP_SAFE_DYNAMICALLY_LINKED_LIBRARY_IMPORT` (defined when linking to the dynamically linked library on Windows, expands to `__declspec(dllimport)`).
	- `CPP_SAFE_STATICALLY_LINKED_LIBRARY_EXPORT` (defined when building the statically linked library on Windows, expands to nothing).
	- `CPP_SAFE_STATICALLY_LINKED_LIBRARY_IMPORT` (defined when linking to the statically linked library on Windows, expands to nothing).

- `safe` — a convenience macro defined in `SafeTrade.h` that expands to `: public Safe::SafeContextBase` to declare a derived type quickly; use with care as macros are not scoped and can affect readability.

- `WINDOWS`, `UNIX` — OS detection macros defined in `SafeNamespace.h` to simplify platform-specific code in the project.

- When building and consuming the dynamic libraries on Windows, ensure to use the same CRT runtime (`/MD` for Release mode or `/MDd` for Debug mode) as of the libraries and define the correct export/import macro.

> [!NOTE]
On Windows, in order to avoid the confusion between the `.lib` files that go with `.dll` in dynamic libraries, `Safe` will use `.sll` as the file extension for static libraries. Linking to the static libraries with `.sll` extension is fine like linking to `.lib` files in other projects.

### Features

The library consists of a namespace called `Safe`. Namespace `Safe` offers several classes for custom managed types and bulk allocation with memory chunks.

- [SafeContextBase](#safecontextbase) — the base type for managed instances; any type that inherits this class will be managed by `Safe` runtime library and doesn't manage memory manually.
- [SafeContextBase::SafeMemoryManager](#safecontextbasesafememorymanager) — internal type; a class that manages memory for `Safe` runtime library and is only provided with a forward declaration.
- [SafeContextBase::SafeMemoryChunk&lt;GenericTypeOfSafeContextDerivative&gt;](#safecontextbasesafememorychunkgenerictypeofsafecontextderivative) — a fixed-size class template that performs bulk arena allocations to gain higher performance.
- [SafeFunction](#safefunction) - a functional class that is managed and essentially wraps `std::function`.
- [SafeEvent](#safeevent) - an event class that provides event-driven mechanisms under the safe context.
- [SafeEventHandler&lt;GenericTypeOfSafeEvent&gt;](#safeeventhandlergenerictypeofsafeevent) - an event class that provides event-driven mechanisms under the safe context.
- [SafeString&lt;GenericTypeOfCharacter&gt;](#safestringgenerictypeofcharacter) - an immutable string class under the safe context.
- [SafeStringBuilder](#safestringbuilder) - an immutable string builder class under the safe context which is responsible for creating instance(s) of `SafeString`.
- [SafeContextException](#safecontextexception) - an exception class that is used for exception handling inside namespace `Safe`.
